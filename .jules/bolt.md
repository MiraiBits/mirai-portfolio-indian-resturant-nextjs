## 2024-05-22 - React Compiler & Manual Memoization
**Learning:** This project has `reactCompiler: true` enabled in `next.config.mjs`. While the compiler handles automatic memoization, extracting list items into separate components (like `MenuItem`) is crucial to allow the compiler to optimize granular updates effectively. We also applied `React.memo` as a defensive optimization to ensure stability during this initial refactor, though future profiling may show it's redundant.
**Action:** Prioritize component extraction. Use `React.memo` judiciously, especially when prop stability is guaranteed, but rely primarily on the compiler for complex render trees.
